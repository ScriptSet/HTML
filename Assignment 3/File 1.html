    <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
    <p>The <b>Ford Mustang</b> is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is
       currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car 
       nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty 
       coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.</p>

    <p>Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the
       1927 Model A.[4] Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units were sold in its
       first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth
       Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.</p>
