    <h2>Mustang</h2>
    <h4>The Name Reflecting a High Perf Car</h4>
    <p>Executive stylist <b>John Najjar</b>, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is credited by Ford with
       suggesting the name. Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the Ford Mustang known as the "Ford Mustang I" in 1961, working
       jointly with fellow Ford stylist <b>Philip T. Clark.</b>. The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix
       in Watkins Glen, New York, on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney lapped 
       the track in a demonstration using the second "race" prototype.</p>
